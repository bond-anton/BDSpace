# Space

**Space** is a python package to simplify positioning, movement, and trajectory calculation for many
different technical problems. It is mainly for multiple interacting bodies systems like coordinate stages
and machining tools, multiple robotic arms, manipulators, etc.

**Space** provides following basic features:
