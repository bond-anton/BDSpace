# Space

**Space** is a python package to simplify positioning, movement, and trajectory calculation for many
different technical problems. It is mainly for multiple interacting bodies systems like coordinate stages
and machining tools, multiple robotic arms, manipulators, etc.

**Space** provides following basic features:

|Feature                               |Staus             |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
|Cartesian coordinate systems          |done              |
|Spherical coordinate systems          |almost done       |
|Cylindrical coordinate systems        |work in progress  |
|Conversion between coordinate systems |work in progress  |
|Multiple nested coordinate systems    |done              |
|Parametric curves                     |done              |
|Trajectory builder (Pathfinder module)|work in progress  |
